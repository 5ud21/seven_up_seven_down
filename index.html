                <br>
                <ul class="game-info">
                    <li>Before the dice are rolled, each player places a bet on one of three outcomes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>7 Down: The sum of the dice will be less than 7 (2 to 6).</li>
                            <li>7 Up: The sum of the dice will be more than 7 (8 to 12).</li>
                            <li>Thala: The sum of the dice will be exactly 7.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>After all bets are placed, the dice roller rolls both dice at once.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="game-info">
                    <li>If the sum of the dice matches the bet of the player, he/she wins.</li>
                    <li>If the sum does not match their bet, they lose.</li>
                    <li>The payout is usually determined based on the type of bet:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>7 Down:</strong> Typically pays 1:1.</li>
                            <li><strong>7 Up:</strong> Typically pays 1:1.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thala:</strong> Since it is a rarer outcome, it pays more, usually 4:1 or 5:1, depending on how the game is organized.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Suppose a player bets 10 chips on 7 Up, and the dice total 9. The player wins 10 chips.</li>
